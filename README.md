The Filter package for laravel, emulates WordPress add/apply filter functions.

## Installation

Require this package with composer:

## Laravel 5.1:

```php
LeeMason\Filter\FilterServiceProvider::class,
```

## Compatability

The Larastaller package has been developed with Laravel 5.1, i see no reason why it wouldn't work with 5.0 or even 4 but it is only tested for 5.1.
